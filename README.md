# Elm DatePicker -component

This is a simple date picker component written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). It's been written as a learning exercise and should be treated as such. It's in my hopes that it will be usable by others as well in the future.

## Trying it out

If you would like to see it in action, the example is not hard to set up, just:

1. Install the [Elm Platform](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform)
1. Clone this repository
1. Go the directory where you cloned this repository
1. Run `elm-make DatePicker.elm`
1. Fire up Elm's dev server with `elm-reactor`
1. Point your browser at http://localhost:8000/index.html
